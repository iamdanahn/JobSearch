# OOP Principles, Java

## Pillars of OOP
1. Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

Abstraction - Hiding implementation details 
Abstracted ex: Using a coffee machine, push the start button
Non-abstracted: Get water, add coffee, grind coffee, etc...

Encapsulation - Hiding details making certain things private
Eg: Create an object and have its properities used in a method, 
but are inaccessible by itself.

Inheritance - Sub-class acquiring Super-class's methods and properties

Polymorphism - an object taking on many forms.
Eg: a parent (super) and child (sub) class can have a method with the same name, 
but they will perform different actions
